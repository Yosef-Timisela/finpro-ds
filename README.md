<h1>Bank Marketing - Predict Term Deposit</h1>

Hi, this is my Final Project as Data Scientist in dibimbing.id. My name is Daniel Yosef Timisela a data enthusiast who has just started my data learning journey
by joining the bootcamp data science batch 31. This project is about making various kinds of machine learning that is suitable for use by dataset that can predict
a customer will take a deposit or not. I got this Dataset Bank Marketing Analysis from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/janiobachmann/bank-marketing-dataset)

Overall Steps:

* Import all libraries & load the dataset
* Business Understanding
* Data Understanding
* Data Pre-processing
* Removing redundant variable based on business value
* Data Preparation: Data Pre-Processing
  * Handling duplicate data
  * Handling outliers
  * Handling missing value
* Checking Heatmap
* EDA for Categorical Data & Numerical Data
* Split Data into Xtrain, ytrain, Xtest, ytest
* Chi-Square Test (Optional)
* Encoding preparation
* Encode separately for data train and data test
* Split Xtrain and Xtest into different categories
* Feature Scaling
* Modeling Machine Learning:
  * Logistic Regression
  * K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
  * Naive Bayes
  * Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  * Decision Tree
  * Random Forest
* Evaluation Model
  * Learning curve Regression
  * Learning curve K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
  * Learning curve Naive Bayes
  * Learning curve Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  * Learning curve Decision Tree
  * Learning curve Random Forest
* Tuning Model
  * Tuning Model Logistic Regression Model with GridSearch and RandomSearch
  * Tuning Model SVM Model with GridSearch and RandomSearch
  * Tuning Model Naive Bayes Model with GridSearch and RandomSearch
* Feature Importance with Dalex

Thank You in Advance!
